## How to mark a person/relationship or group as deleted

Go to `admin/content` and search for the name of the person or group you wish to mark as deleted.

Marking a person/relationship/group as deleted is done by editing the person/relationship/group, checking the deleted checkbox, and saving:

### Note the following:

1. A Person cannot be marked as deleted if it has measurements.
2. Marking a person as deleted causes all its relationships and participants (group and encounter) to be marked as deleted.

### **On the app**

Deleted person will no longer show in the search results at:

* Participant directory (main + creating relationship screen)
* Individual encounters
* Group encounter (when either adult or child is marked as deleted)

_Note: Make sure that the device is fully synced to make it aware of the 'deleted' content._
