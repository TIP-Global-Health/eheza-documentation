## Format of spreadsheet

The template can be found [**here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10dC23Ag90oOOQdLFbqSu_6bU6L2CtQzO).

Use this folder to copy the templates and add google sheets to be referenced for the bulk import.

### Child

[**TEMPLATE to copy**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zOoJqrZtelLaXQNU9VvluVekHQDcp2bfKk4HNkF50qY/edit#gid=0)

(_red is required, blue is optional_)

### Mother/Caregiver

[**TEMPLATE to copy**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LIzLl293UwtuBKRP3AWD2Qo7-grH_WRRslOWYsH7Roo/edit#gid=0)

(_red is required, blue is optional_)

### Notes

* Date format: **`dd-Jan-yyyy`** (2 digits for day: `01-Jan-1990`)
* Last name: All upper case
* National ID: 16 digits (if not known, leave cell blank)
* The names for the health center and group need to match exactly those in the backend
* A Mother needs to be added only once, even if she has multiple children

## Mapping

As a first instance, we use National ID to map children to mothers. For those that don't have a National ID, let's apply:

* Mother first and last name are filled (at Mothers Excel sheet).
* First + Last name combination is unique (at Mothers Excel sheet).
* Child's mother name spelling (at Children Excel sheet) matches exactly to what we have at Mothers Excel sheet.

## Upload in admin

### Things to check before uploading

* **Make sure the spreadsheet is a Google Sheet**

{{< media image_path="/uploads/save_google_sheet.png" class="half" >}}

* **Check the share settings. It needs to be set to "Anyone with the link".**

{{< media image_path="/uploads/share_sheet.png" class="half" >}}

{{< media image_path="/uploads/anyone_with_link.png" class="half" >}}

### Enter the Google Sheet ID

To upload the data, you need to enter the Google Sheet ID. It is not the entire URL to the sheet, but this piece here:

{{< media image_path="/uploads/copy_google_id.png" class="half" >}}

{{< media image_path="/uploads/enter_google_id.png" class="half" >}}

**_Note_**_: You'll need to import the mothers first, then the children. The children input checks if mothers/caregivers exist in order to create the relationship._
