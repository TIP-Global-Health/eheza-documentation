2. In the Title field enter the group name.

3. In the Health Center field add the name of the Health Center that this group is under.

Note: A Group should never be deleted when there are other entities (mothers/children/nurses) referring to it. If you must delete a clinic, you must first unassign entities that are connected to it.
