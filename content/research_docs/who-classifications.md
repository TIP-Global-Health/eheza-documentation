---

The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Digital Health Interventions v1.0 attempts to create a shared language to describe the uses of digital technology for health. [According to the WHO](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/260480), the classification of digital health interventions (DHIs) categorizes the different ways in which digital and mobile technologies are being used to support health system needs.

E-Heza is classified primarily as a Electronic Medical Record (Category H), but also serves interventions in the following categories:

- Category F - Community-based information system
- Category D - Client communication system
- Category R - Laboratory and diagnostics information system
-= Category V - Public health and disease surveillance system

To see the complete set of linkages between healthcare challenges, interventions and WHO classifications, see [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wE704VngGdF7SdzP24RJ9cG9ld_QGqsNcQ3i3ggqzts/edit?usp=sharing) maintained by the E-Heza Executive Committee.
