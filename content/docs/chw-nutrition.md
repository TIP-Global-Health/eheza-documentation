## **Nutrition Module @ Community Level**

The Nutrition Module at the CHW level allows early detection of malnutrition in children at the community level, allowing them to be referred to a health center nutrition program.

**General Nutrition Encounter**  
There are five activities in the Nutrition Module at the CHW level: MUAC, nutrition, height, weight, and photo.

MUAC collects the circumference of the child’s arm in centimeters and indicates immediately with a red or green arrow if the child is above or below where they should be.

Photo is used to track the growth of a child. A favorite feature among children, parents, and healthcare workers!

**Nutrition Home Encounter**

At the CHW level, E-Heza also supports Nutrition Home Visits. This type of encounter has four activities: feeding, caring, hygiene, and food security.

Feeding allows a CHW to follow up on if the child is receiving the correct amounts of food supplement, type of supplemental food, and any problems the child may be facing to eat adequate amounts of the food.

Caring allows the CHW to check in on who the primary caregiver of a child is and that they are being kept clean.
