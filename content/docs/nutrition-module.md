## **Nutrition**

The Nutrition Module allows nurses at Health Centers to screen children for signs of malnutrition, refer them to the correct program, and then follow up via group nutrition encounters.

There are 5 activities in the Nutrition Module: height, MUAC, weight, nutrition, and photo.

Height collects the height of a child in centimeters, automatically calculates their Z-Score, and highlights with a red or green arrow if they are above or below where they should be.

MUAC collects the circumference of the childâ€™s arm in centimeters and indicates immediately with a red or green arrow if the child is above or below where they should be.

Weight collects the weight of a child in kilograms, automatically calculates their Z-Score for height and age, and highlights with a red or green arrow if they are above or below where they should be.

Nutrition collects data regarding visible signs of malnutrition in a child (e.g. edema or brittle hair.

Photo is used to track the growth of a child. A favorite feature among children, parents, and healthcare workers!
