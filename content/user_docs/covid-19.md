Acute Illness encounters at both the Health Center and CHW level accommodate for a COVID-19 diagnosis. At the Health Center level, this specific flow allows for rapid testing, medication distribution, and contact tracing.

When a patient is suspected of having COVID at the Health Center level, they will be given a rapid test to confirm a diagnosis. They will then undergo a more in-depth physical exam to determine how severe their COVID case is. E-Heza will then direct the nurse on the appropriate next steps and medication distribution (if applicable).

Contact tracing allows the nurse to collect contact information and store it in the E-Heza system for follow-up. Contacts then appear in the nurseâ€™s case management and are followed up with via telephone for ten days past contact with the index patient. If a patient has symptoms of COVID, they are directed to their nearest health center. This feature is currently used only for COVID-19 and can easily be used for other instances that require it.
