After being diagnosed with COVID-19, the patient is then asked to recount the names of everyone they can remember coming into contact with since their COVID-19 symptoms began. The nurse will collect the contact’s name, phone number, and as much geographic data that’s known in E-Heza. This data is later pushed to Case Management for contact tracing purposes.
