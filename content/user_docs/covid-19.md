After being diagnosed with COVID-19, the patient is then asked to recount the names of everyone they can remember coming into contact with since their COVID-19 symptoms began. The nurse will collect the contact’s name, phone number, and as much geographic data that’s known in E-Heza. This data is later pushed to Case Management for contact tracing purposes.

Contact tracing allows the nurse to collect contact information and store it in the E-Heza system for follow-up. Contacts then appear in the nurse’s case management and are followed up with via telephone for ten days past contact with the index patient. If a patient has symptoms of COVID, they are directed to their nearest health center. This feature is currently used only for COVID-19 and can easily be used for other instances that require it.
