## **Group vs Individual Encounter**

E-Heza supports both group and individual encounters at both the CHW and Health Center levels. This feature allows health care workers to perform large group assessments more efficiently and reduces burnout.

At the CHW level, E-Heza is built out to accommodate both 1:1 visits, as well as group encounters. A CHW can choose to start a group encounter which allows them to collect height, weight, MUAC, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Photos for each individual in a group setting. This allows CHWâ€™s to perform their tasks more efficiently.

Here is an example of what a group encounter screen may look like within an individual activity:

At the Health Center level, E-Heza is built out to support group encounters for the Nutrition programs the software supports. This allows a nurse to collect information on height, weight, MUAC, FBF Distribution, Family Planning, Lactation, and Photos for each individual.

Here is an example of what a group encounter screen may look like for a nutrition program:
