CHWs conduct monthly group nutrition assessments. This module allows CHWs to take attendance, and to toggle between individual mother/child pain and activities. Z scores are automatically calculated. Family planning assessments are conducted at the same time, and a mother's record is linked to her child for easy joint evaluations.
