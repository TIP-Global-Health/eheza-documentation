A single progress report organizes all important information required for effective antenatal care. This includes risk factors, obstetrical and medical history, milestones tracker, and trends for BMI and fundal height to inform care decisions and engage pregnant women in the progress of their pregnancies. CHW activities also appear on this shared progress report.
