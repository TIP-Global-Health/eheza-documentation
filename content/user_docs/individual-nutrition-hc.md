The Nutrition Module allows nurses at Health Centers to screen children for signs of malnutrition, refer them to the correct program, and then follow up via group nutrition encounters. 

There are 5 activities in the Nutrition Module: height, MUAC, weight, nutrition, and photo.

Height collects the height of a child in centimeters, automatically calculates their Z-Score, and highlights with a red or green arrow if they are above or below where they should be.
