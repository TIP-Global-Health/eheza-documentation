Contact tracing allows the nurse to collect contact information and store it in the E-Heza system for follow-up. Contacts then appear in the nurseâ€™s case management and are followed up with via telephone for ten days past contact with the index patient. If a patient has symptoms of COVID, they are directed to their nearest health center. This feature is currently used only for COVID-19 and can easily be used for other instances that require it.
