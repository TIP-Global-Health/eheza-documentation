# Non-Communicable Disease (NCD)

This module allows Health Centers to manage patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The module allows nurses to provide health education to help patients better manage their condition, as well as prescribe and monitor responses to medications.

The module is made up of 6 activities: danger signs, symptom review, medical history, physical exam, labs, and family planning.

**Danger Signs**

The Danger Signs activity allows E-Heza to identify if there are any immediate dangers to a patient's health and/or any complicating factors to a diagnosis.

**Symptom Review**

The Symptom Review Activity allows the nurse to identify symptoms that a patient is experiencing that may later be used in creating a diagnosis.

**Medical History**

The medical history activity has 5 sub-activities.

_Co-Morbidities_

This sub-activity identifies any co-morbidities a patient may have. Co-morbidities may influence the diagnosis or next steps that E-Heza provides. This sub-activity only appears in the first encounter.

_Medication History_

This sub-activity identifies any medication that a patient is on or has taken in the past that may cause hypertension, treat hypertension, or treat diabetes. These medications may influence a patient's test results and therefore skew a diagnosis. This sub-activity only appears in the first encounter.

_Social History_

This sub-activity allows a nurse to walk through social activities such as smoking, drinking alcohol, or an unhealthy diet that may contribute to or worsen a patient's health. This sub-activity only appears in the first encounter.

_Family History_

This sub-activity allows a nurse to identify if a patient has a family history of any major medical condition that may affect their patient. This sub-activity only appears in the first encounter.

_Outside Care_

This activity allows E-Heza to track what, if any, medications a patient has received from an outside facility. These results are then tracked on the patient's Progress Report. This sub-activity appears in every NCD encounter.

**Physical Exam**

This activity has two sub activities.

_Vitals_

E-Heza tracks systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. In the case of NCDs, the systolic and diastolic are critical data points in confirming a diagnosis. These two data points are also tracked over time on a patients progress report.

_Core Exam_

The Core Exam in E-Heza addresses symptoms and conditions related to: head/hair, eyes, neck, heart, heart murmur, lungs, abdomen, and extremities.

**Labs**

In the NCD module, we run the following labs: Random Blood Sugar, Creatinine, Urine Dipstick, HIV, Pregnancy, and Lipids. A user will order the labs during the encounter and then return via Case Management to input lab results when available. Please see t[his page ](https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/laboratory-with-pending-results-management/)in our wiki to learn more about how lab results work within E-Heza.

**Family Planning**

This activity is only presented to women of childbearing age. It allows E-Heza to track the most recent family planning method a woman is using, allowing nurses to provide appropriate guidance and education.

**Next Steps**

In the NCD Module, we provide health education, medication distribution, and hospital referrals via the next steps module. To see the most up-to-date diagnosis logic for E-Heza please view this document.
