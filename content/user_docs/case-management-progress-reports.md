Case Management allows both CHW’s and nurses to manage their patients. On the CHW side, Case Management includes patients who have an active acute illness, an active pregnancy, are participating in a child nutrition program, and general family planning patients. At the Health Center, nurses are able to manage ANC patients awaiting lab results and perform COVID contact tracing calls.

E-Heza supports a variety of patient progress reports including U5 Pediatric Progress Reports, Antenatal Progress Reports, general Acute Illness Reports, and Demographic Reports. These reports allow health care workers to track the progress of their patients over time as individuals and as a group.

Here are some examples:
