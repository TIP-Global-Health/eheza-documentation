At the CHW level, E-Heza also supports Nutrition Home Visits. This allows CHWs to conduct the MoH-recommended home health assessment for malnourished children. This includes an assessment of feeding practices, caregiving, hygiene, and food security.

Feeding allows a CHW to follow up on if the child is receiving the correct amounts of food supplement, type of supplemental food, and any problems the child may be facing to eat adequate amounts of the food.

Caring allows the CHW to check in on who the primary caregiver of a child is and that they are being kept clean.

Hygiene collects information about the householdâ€™s water source to ensure that the child has access to clean water.

Food Security collects information about the household's primary source of income and their current food availability.
