+++
A single progress report organizes all important information required for effective Antenatal Care. This includes all evaluations and documentation conducted at health centers - such as risk factors, obstetrical and medical history, milestones tracker, and trends for BMI and fundal height to inform care decisions and engage pregnant women in the progress of their pregnancies. CHWs review this progress report with pregnant women during their home visits. The progress report also documents the CHW visits and types of health education provided.
