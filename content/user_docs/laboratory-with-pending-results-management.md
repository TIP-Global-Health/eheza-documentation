This activity is embedded into the antenatal care module. The midwife or nurse can conduct point of care tests and document the results into E-Heza. She can also order lab tests to be performed at the lab on the day of care. When results are available, a Laboratory case management system notifies her that results are ready to be reviewed with the pregnant woman.
