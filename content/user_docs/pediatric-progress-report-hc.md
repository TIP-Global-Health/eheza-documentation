A single progress report organizes all important information required for effective pediatric care. This includes all evaluations and documentation conducted at health centers - such as acute illness history, immunizations, early child education milestones, growth and weight charts, malnutrition indicator tracking, and follow-up appointment schedule. This progress report can be seen by both the CHW and the health centers and tracks information at both levels.
