Nurses login to a device using a PIN code that is assigned by an admin or is automatically generated when the nurse is created. A nurse cannot reset their own PIN code or request that it be reset in any automated way.

Notes about login and logout.

- Login is not dependent on being connected to the Internet. You can login and logout while offline.
- The device should be secured in another way using device security as the device will contain data related to the current Health Centers. A malicious use could gain access to the device if they guess or obtain a nurse's PIN.
