This module allows nurses at Health Centers to take run group encounters for supplemental nutrition programs. They are able to take attendance and to toggle between individual mother/child pairs and activities. Z scores are automatically calculated. Family planning assessments are conducted at the same time, and a mother's record is linked to her child for easy joint evaluations.
