## Workforce-Staff and Contractors

I understand that I require information to perform my duties at TIP Global Health by which I am engaged
or for which I am performing services. This information may include, but is not limited to, information
on patients, employees, other workforce members, donors, research, and financial and business
operations. Confidential information may be in any form, e.g., written, electronic, oral, overheard or
observed. I also understand that access to all confidential information is granted on a need-to-know
basis. A need-to- know is defined as information access that is required in order to perform my work.
I will not disclose confidential information to patients, friends, relatives, co-workers or anyone else
except as permitted by TIP Global Health policies and applicable law and as required to perform my work
as a consultant, contractor or vendor for TIP Global Health.
I will protect the confidentiality of all confidential information, including Protected Health Information
(PHI), while at TIP Global Health and after I leave TIP Global Health. All confidential information remains
the property of TIP Global Health and may not be removed or kept by me when I leave TIP Global Health
except as permitted by TIP Global Health policies or specific agreements or arrangements applicable to
my work as a consultant, contractor or vendor for TIP Global Health.
If I violate this agreement, I may be subject to adverse action up to and including termination of my
ability to work at or on behalf of TIP Global Health. In addition, under applicable law, I may be subject to
criminal or civil penalties.

I have read and understand the above and agree to be bound by it.
