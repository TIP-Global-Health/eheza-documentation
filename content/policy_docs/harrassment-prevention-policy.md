TIP Global Health is committed to providing a work environment free of any form of harassment. Our policy prohibits sexual harassment and harassment because of or perception of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, race, religious creed, color, gender, national origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sexual orientation, age, gender, gender identity, genetic information, gender expression, veteran status, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law or ordinance or regulation. All such harassment is unlawful. Our harassment prevention policy applies to all persons involved in our operations and prohibits unlawful harassment by any employee of our organization, including supervisors and co-workers, as well as by or of any person doing business with or for our organization including subcontractors, supplier and volunteers.

Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, making unwanted sexual advances and requests for sexual favors where either:
1. Submission to such conduct is made an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment and/or advancement; or
2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis of employment decisions affecting such individual; or
3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individualâ€™s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

Prohibited unlawful harassment because of sex, race, ancestry, physical handicap, mental condition, marital status, age, religion, gender identity, genetic information, gender expression, citizenship, veteran status, or any other protected basis includes, but is not limited to, the following behavior:

- Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory jokes or comments, slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments;
- Visual conduct such as derogatory and/or sexually oriented posters, photography, cartoons, drawings, e-mail and faxes or gestures;
- Physical conduct such as assault, unwanted touching, blocking normal movement or interfering with work because of sex, race or any other protected basis;
- Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests as a condition of continued employment, or to avoid some other loss, and offers of employment benefits in return for sexual favors; and
- Retaliation for having reported or threatened to report harassment.

If you believe that you have been unlawfully harassed by a co-worker, supervisor, or agent of the organization or non-employee, you should promptly report the facts of the incident or incidents and the names of the individual(s) to your supervisor, or in the alternative to the Director of Human Resources. It is the responsibility of each employee to immediately report any violation or suspected violation of this policy to one of more of the individuals identified above. Supervisors should immediately report any incidents of harassment to the Director of Human Resources.

Upon receipt of a complaint, the organization will undertake a thorough, objective and good-faith investigation of the harassment allegations.

If the organization determines that harassment has occurred, effective remedial action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. Any employee determined by the organization to be responsible for harassment will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

You will not be retaliated against for filing a complaint and/or assisting in a complaint or investigation process. Further, we will not tolerate or permit retaliation by supervisors or co-workers against any complainant or anyone assisting in a harassment investigation.

The Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing investigate and prosecute complaints of prohibited harassment in employment. If you believe you have been harassed or discriminated against, or that you have been retaliated against for resisting or complaining, you may also file a complaint with the appropriate agency in addition to exhausting the above complaint procedure. An information brochure from the Department of Fair Employment and Housing is provided to employees when they are hired and is available from the Human Resources representative. In addition, the Department poster explaining unlawful harassment and your rights is posted in the workplace.

*If you have any questions concerning this policy, please feel free to contact the Executive Director or Rwanda Country Director.*
