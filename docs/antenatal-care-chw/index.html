A nurse at a Health Center can see what has happened in CHW visits and seamlessly continue care.</p><p>There are 7 main activities in this module and they appear when appropriate in the pregnancy. The main activities are: Pregnancy Dating, Labs, Danger Signs, Birth Plan, Health Education, Appointment Confirmation, and Pregnancy Outcome.</p><p>Pregnancy Dating confirms the last menstrual period (LMP), which in turn informs the Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Estimated Gestational Age (EGA). Once seen at a Health Center, this information is confirmed by a nurse.</p><p>Labs are basic labs to confirm the pregnancy, such as a simple Pregnancy Test.</p><p>Danger Signs outlines if a mother is currently experiencing any danger signs which would implicate a larger issue and requires her to be seen at a Health Center immediately.</p><p>Birth Plan allows the CHW and the patient to discuss the intended birth plan, ensure the mother has all the essential items she needs, discuss post-partum family planning, and more.</p><p>Health Education guides the CHW each visit on what topics to cover with the patient from what to expect during pregnancy to hemorrhaging.</p><p>Appointment Confirmation allows the CHW to confirm an appointment at the Health Center was scheduled for their patient and, if not, schedule one for them.</p><p>Pregnancy Outcome is performed post-partum and details any danger signs the mother or baby is experiencing and registers the newborn in the E-Heza system.</p></section></div><footer class=footer><div class="footer container"></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/app.min.e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.js integrity="sha256-47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=" media=screen></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/anchor-js/4.2.2/anchor.min.js></script></body></html>
