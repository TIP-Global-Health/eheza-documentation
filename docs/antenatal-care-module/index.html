A nurse at a Health Center can see what has happened in CHW visits and seamlessly continue care.</p><p>There are nine main activities in the ANC module. Activities appear in the main tray of E-Heza depending on which of their ANC visits a patient is on. The activities are Pregnancy Dating, History, Examination, Family Planning, Medication, Malaria Prevention, Medication Distribution, Danger Signs, Labs, and Photo.</p><p>Pregnancy Dating confirms the last menstrual period (LMP), which in turn informs the Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Estimated Gestational Age (EGA). A nurse is able to confirm the LMP entered by the CHW, if a CHW has been seen previously.</p><p>History is comprised of three sub-activities Obstetric History, Medical History, and Partner Information. These work together to inform Gravida and Para, as well as identify any previous complications during childbirth. E-Heza also screens both the mother and the partner for HIV, while also providing health education to both.</p><p>The examination is comprised of five sub-activities Vitals, Nutrition Assessment, Core Exam, Obstetrical Exam, and Breast Exam. E-Heza uses these sub-activities to ascertain if there are any symptoms that could cause a complication in the pregnancy and/or the birth of the child.</p><p>Family Planning notes what, if any, methods of family planning will be used by the couple after the conclusion of the current pregnancy.</p><p>Malaria Prevention details if a mother has received a mosquito net.</p><p>Medication Distribution details if a mother has received iron and folic acid supplement.</p><p>Danger Signs outlines if a mother is currently experiencing any danger signs which would implicate a larger issue or indicate she is a high-risk pregnancy (e.g. vaginal bleeding or fever).</p><p>Labs are run at every ANC visit at a Health Center. E-Heza currently runs labs for HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B, Malaria, Blood Group, Rhesus, Urine Dipstick, Random Blood Sugar, and Hemoglobin.</p><p>The photo activity allows E-Heza to visually track the progression of the pregnancy - and the patients love to see them as well!</p></section></div><footer class=footer><div class="footer container"></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=https://gizra.github.io/eheza-guide/app.min.e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.js integrity="sha256-47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=" media=screen></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/anchor-js/4.2.2/anchor.min.js></script></body></html>
