If a patient has been in an area that is known to be high-risk, E-Heza then follows COVID protocol.</p><p>Prior Treatment History determines whether a patient is currently taking treatment for fever or Malaria - and if this treatment is helping. This further informs a diagnosis later in the flow.</p><p>Physical Exam collects information on vitals (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate), core exam (e.g. heart and lung symptoms), MUAC, signs of a nutritional deficiency, and any acute findings (e.g. jaundice or stridor)</p><p>After an initial diagnosis is made, it can be confirmed with laboratory testing (e.g. rapid malaria or COVID-19 test.).</p><p>The next steps are outlined depending on the diagnosis and severity of the illness. The next steps will outline medication to distribute, general health education, and allow a Nurse to schedule follow-ups with a CHW.</p><p>Contact tracing is currently used for COVID-19 and can easily be used for other instances that require it.</p></section></div><footer class=footer><div class="footer container"></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/app.min.e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.js integrity="sha256-47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=" media=screen></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/anchor-js/4.2.2/anchor.min.js></script></body></html>
