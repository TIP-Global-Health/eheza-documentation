This sync only needs to be performed once for a device, but it is important that it is done fully before the device can be used.</div><p>You can access the device status page using the icon at the top middle of the screen.</p><div class="image-container half"><div class=image><img src=https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/uploads/device-status-icon.jpg></div></div><p>In this step, we are concerned only with the data under the Sync Status (General)</p><p>This is what that section looks like when there is still data left to sync:</p><div class="image-container half"><div class=image><img src=https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/uploads/items-remaining.jpg></div></div><p>This is what that section looks like when the syncing is complete:</p><div class="image-container half"><div class=image><img src=https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/uploads/no-items-remaining.jpg></div></div><p>There are a few things to note about the initial sync process:</p><ul><li>A &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; device will not sync - during this step the device needs to be attended and kept in awake mode (or the settings should be changed so that it never goes to sleep)</li><li>The sync can hang at certain intervals. Most of the time the device will recover on it&rsquo;s own after a few minutes of idleness - in fact, we haven&rsquo;t had a case yet, where it doesn&rsquo;t recover. We&rsquo;ve seen cases where it sits idle for up to 10 minutes.</li></ul><p>There are two things you can do to manually recover the sync process:
- refresh the app screen (pull down the page for a refresh)
- completely exit the app (be sure that it is closed) and open it up again</p><ul><li>You should only attempt to log in to a device that is fully synced.</li></ul></section></div><footer class=footer><div class="footer container"></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/app.min.e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.js integrity="sha256-47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=" media=screen></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/anchor-js/4.2.2/anchor.min.js></script></body></html>
