Complete with early childhood development (ECD), nutrition, and immunization tracking, SPV helps ensure that young children are on track in all aspects of development.</p><p>There are 6 main activities in the SPV module: Danger Signs, Nutrition Assessment, Immunizations, ECD, medication, and photo.</p><p>Danger Signs is comprised of two sub-activities: symptom review and vitals. This sub-activity is used to immediately identify if there are any acute or more pressing illnesses with the child before continuing with the exam.</p><p>Nutrition Assessment is comprised of five sub-activities: height, head circumference, MUAC, nutrition, and weight. These combine to alert the Nurse if a child is malnourished or shows signs of macro/microcephaly. If a child does show signs of malnutrition, a nurse will then be able to recommend the child to the correct nutrition program - which is also tracked in E-Heza.</p><p>Immunizations tracks that a child is up to date with all of their required immunizations. Children in Rwanda, as of Fall 2021, receive the following immunizations: Oral Polio Vaccine, Inactivated Polio Vaccine, DTP-HepB-Hib, PCV 13, Rotarix, Measles-Rubella, and HPV (only for girls at age 12).</p><p>ECD tracks key developmental milestones over the first 5 years of life. Examples include: turning from their tummy to their back and making consonant sounds to playing make-believe as they are older.</p><p>Medication is used to ensure that children are getting the appropriate doses of Vitamin A, Mebendazole, and Albendazole depending on their age.</p><p>Photo is used to track the growth of a child. A favorite feature among children, parents, and healthcare workers!</p></section></div><footer class=footer><div class="footer container"></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=https://gizra.github.io/eheza-guide/app.min.e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.js integrity="sha256-47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=" media=screen></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/anchor-js/4.2.2/anchor.min.js></script></body></html>
