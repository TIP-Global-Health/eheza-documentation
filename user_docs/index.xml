This feature allows health care workers to perform large group assessments more efficiently and reduces burnout.
At the CHW level, E-Heza is built out to accommodate both 1:1 visits, as well as group encounters. A CHW can choose to start a group encounter which allows them to collect height, weight, MUAC, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Photos for each individual in a group setting.</description></item><item><title>Pregnancy - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-chw/</guid><description>This module allows CHWs to identify and register pregnant women in their villages. CHWs can provide health education tailored to the pregnant woman&amp;rsquo;s trimester of pregnancy and she can review pregnancy progress on the progress report. The tool prompts the CHW to schedule her follow up home visit and allows her to tell the pregnant woman when she needs to attend her next facility ANC visit.
The Antenatal Care (ANC) module for CHW’s works collaboratively with the CHW module.</description></item><item><title>Pregnancy - Health Center Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-module/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-module/</guid><description>The Antenatal Care (ANC) module at the Health Center works collaboratively with the CHW module. A nurse at a Health Center can see what has happened in CHW visits and seamlessly continue care.
