CHW’s are able to diagnose patients on the spot, provide immediate care and health education, or direct patients to a health center to receive further care.
There are four main activities in the Acute Illness module: Symptom Review, Exposure/Travel History, Prior Treatment History, and Physical Exam.
Symptom Review allows a CHW to do an inventory of General, Respiratory, and Gastrointestinal symptoms to inform their diagnosis.</description></item><item><title>Group vs. Individual Encounters</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/group-vs.individual-encounters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/group-vs.individual-encounters/</guid><description>Group vs Individual Encounter E-Heza supports both group and individual encounters at both the CHW and Health Center levels. This feature allows health care workers to perform large group assessments more efficiently and reduces burnout.
At the CHW level, E-Heza is built out to accommodate both 1:1 visits, as well as group encounters. A CHW can choose to start a group encounter which allows them to collect height, weight, MUAC, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Photos for each individual in a group setting.</description></item><item><title>Pregnancy - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-chw/</guid><description>The Antenatal Care (ANC) module for CHW’s works collaboratively with the CHW module. A nurse at a Health Center can see what has happened in CHW visits and seamlessly continue care.
There are 7 main activities in this module and they appear when appropriate in the pregnancy. The main activities are: Pregnancy Dating, Labs, Danger Signs, Birth Plan, Health Education, Appointment Confirmation, and Pregnancy Outcome.
Pregnancy Dating confirms the last menstrual period (LMP), which in turn informs the Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Estimated Gestational Age (EGA).</description></item><item><title>Acute Illness Progress Reports</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-progress-reports-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-progress-reports-chw/</guid><description>Case Management allows both CHW’s and nurses to manage their patients. On the CHW side, Case Management includes patients who have an active acute illness, an active pregnancy, are participating in a child nutrition program, and general family planning patients. At the Health Center, nurses are able to manage ANC patients awaiting lab results and perform COVID contact tracing calls.
E-Heza supports a variety of patient progress reports including U5 Pediatric Progress Reports, Antenatal Progress Reports, general Acute Illness Reports, and Demographic Reports.</description></item><item><title>Diagnosis, Treatment, and Referral of Malnutrition</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/chw-nutrition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/chw-nutrition/</guid><description>The Nutrition Module at the CHW level allows early detection of malnutrition in children at the community level, allowing them to be referred to a health center nutrition program.
General Nutrition Encounter
There are five activities in the Nutrition Module at the CHW level: MUAC, nutrition, height, weight, and photo.
MUAC collects the circumference of the child’s arm in centimeters and indicates immediately with a red or green arrow if the child is above or below where they should be.</description></item><item><title>Post-Partum - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-postpartum-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-postpartum-chw/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Case Management - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-case-managment-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-case-managment-chw/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Case Management - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/nutrition-case-management-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/nutrition-case-management-chw/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Newborn - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/chw-newborn-exam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/chw-newborn-exam/</guid><description>The Newborn Exam is performed, when applicable, after an Antenatal Post-Partum encounter, once a newborn has been registered in E-Heza. The Newborn Exam allows CHW’s to check in on a child, ensure that it has received the necessary immunizations, and begin tracking the child’s growth and development.
There are 3 main activities in the Newborn Exam: history, immunizations, and nutrition assessment.
History confirms if the baby was born on the estimated due date and if there were any complications with the delivery.</description></item><item><title>Case Management - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-case-management-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-case-management-chw/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Community Acute Illness Dashboards</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-dashboards-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-dashboards-chw/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dashboards - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/nutrition-dashboards-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/nutrition-dashboards-chw/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ANC Dashboards - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-dashboards-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-dashboards-chw/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Acute Illness</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/acute-illness-module/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/acute-illness-module/</guid><description>The Acute Illness module at Health Center’s is able to collect more information than at the CHW level as there are more tools at the Nurse’s disposal at the Health Center.
