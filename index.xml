There are four main activities in the Acute Illness module: Symptom Review, Exposure/Travel History, Prior Treatment History, and Physical Exam.
Symptom Review allows a Nurse to do an inventory of General, Respiratory, and Gastrointestinal symptoms to inform their diagnosis.</description></item><item><title>Diagnosis, Treatment, and Referral of Childhood Illnesses - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/acute-illness-module-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/acute-illness-module-chw/</guid><description>Established to support CHWs' ability to continue their work despite COVID-19. Allows CHWs to screen for COVID-19, identify, isolate and refer suspects. If COVID-19 not suspected, allows CHWs to evaluate for, diagnose, treat, and refer if needed cases of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Decision matrices tailored to the needs of all age groups and subpopulations (ex. pregnant women).

This feature allows health care workers to perform large group assessments more efficiently and reduces burnout.
At the CHW level, E-Heza is built out to accommodate both 1:1 visits, as well as group encounters. A CHW can choose to start a group encounter which allows them to collect height, weight, MUAC, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Photos for each individual in a group setting.</description></item><item><title>Pregnancy - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-chw/</guid><description>This module allows CHWs to identify and register pregnant women in their villages. CHWs can provide health education tailored to the pregnant woman&amp;rsquo;s trimester of pregnancy and she can review pregnancy progress on the progress report. The tool prompts the CHW to schedule her follow up home visit and allows her to tell the pregnant woman when she needs to attend her next facility ANC visit.
The Antenatal Care (ANC) module for CHW’s works collaboratively with the CHW module.</description></item><item><title>Pregnancy - Health Center Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-module/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/antenatal-care-module/</guid><description>This module allows midwives and nurses to provide full-scope antenatal care services. The module is trimester-responsive while ensuring tasks expected in earlier trimesters are completed if a pregnant woman accesses care later in her pregnancy. It features automated calculations for the estimated due date, gestational age, and Gravida/Para.
The Antenatal Care (ANC) module at the Health Center works collaboratively with the CHW module. A nurse at a Health Center can see what has happened in CHW visits and seamlessly continue care.</description></item><item><title>Standard Pediatric Care Visit</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/standard-pediatric-visit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/standard-pediatric-visit/</guid><description>The Standard Pediatric Visit module (SPV) at the Health Center focuses on the health and development of children under 5 years of age. Complete with early childhood development (ECD), nutrition, and immunization tracking, SPV helps ensure that young children are on track in all aspects of development.
There are 6 main activities in the SPV module: Danger Signs, Nutrition Assessment, Immunizations, ECD, medication, and photo.
Danger Signs is comprised of two sub-activities: symptom review and vitals.</description></item><item><title>ANC Progress Report - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-progress-report-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/anc-progress-report-chw/</guid><description>A single progress report organizes all important information required for effective Antenatal Care. This includes all evaluations and documentation conducted at health centers - such as risk factors, obstetrical and medical history, milestones tracker, and trends for BMI and fundal height to inform care decisions and engage pregnant women in the progress of their pregnancies. CHWs review this progress report with pregnant women during their home visits.

At the Health Center level, this specific flow allows for rapid testing, medication distribution, and contact tracing.
When a patient is suspected of having COVID at the Health Center level, they will be given a rapid test to confirm a diagnosis. They will then undergo a more in-depth physical exam to determine how severe their COVID case is.</description></item><item><title>IMCI Progress Reports - CHW Workflow</title><link>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-progress-reports-chw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tip-global-health.github.io/eheza-documentation/user_docs/ai-progress-reports-chw/</guid><description>This provides a summary of the patient&amp;rsquo;s symptoms, vital signs if taken, diagnosis, treatment, and next steps.
E-Heza supports a variety of patient progress reports including U5 Pediatric, Antenatal, Childhood Illnesses, and Demographic Progress Reports.
